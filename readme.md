Hello, this is where I post all my done, done discord.py projects in one. I want anyone to take this projects for free and yes, open source.

But! I must warn you! I've only used Python 3.9 for everything, so you must have 3.9 installed on your systems for it to work (if you got it running without the need of 3.9, then you're luckyðŸ§¸)
